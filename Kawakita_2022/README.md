This repository contains a MATLAB code for computing the optimal control cost in stochastic systems by solving the Schrödinger’s bridge problem (solveSBP.m). \
Please run "SB_demo.m" first for understanding how to use the code. \

For solving the Schrödinger’s bridge problem (mathematically equivalent to the entropy-reguralized optimal transport problem), Sinkhorn's algorithm implemented by Marco Cuturi (sinkhornTransport.m) is used. \

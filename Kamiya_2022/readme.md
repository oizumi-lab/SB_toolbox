# Kamiya_2022
This repository contains a MATLAB code for computing the optimal control cost in stochastic systems by computing the analytical solution of the Schrödinger’s bridge problem in a linear model. 

"demo_compute_stochastic_control_cost.m" executes a demo for computation and visualization of stochastic contorl costs.
"Compute_Control_Cost.m" and others are functions necesasry for computing the stochastic control costs.
